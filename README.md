# Criteria

1. Account should be required. Username should be used to identify users.
2. Any user can create a chat.
3. Any user can join any chat.
4. Messages should persist.
5. Most recent messages should be at bottom.
6. There should be a list of chats with the count of users in each chat.
7. Use ruby, bootstrap, any JS you need. Elixir is fine too.
8. Test where you think appropriate.
9. Push to Heroku and github.

I did not implement 2, so subsequently, 6 is not implemeneted.

The goal was to get a functional 1-1 chat joinable upon session start.
